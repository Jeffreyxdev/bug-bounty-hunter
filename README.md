# Bug Bounty Hunter

> All-round bug bounty skill for Claude Code — parallelized agents for smart contract audits (EVM, Move, Solana, TRON), web/API security, and submission-ready reports for HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti & Immunefi.

---

## What It Does

Bug Bounty Hunter spins up **8 specialized security agents in parallel**, each attacking a different surface of your target. Findings are deduplicated, gate-evaluated, CVSS-scored, and formatted into a submission-ready report — in minutes.

| Agent | Covers |
|---|---|
| Web / API | Auth bypass, IDOR, XSS, SSRF, SQLi, GraphQL, CORS |
| Smart Contract | EVM, Move/Aptos, Solana, TRON — structural & chain-specific bugs |
| Access Control | Role bypass, init hijack, confused deputy, proxy admin |
| Business Logic | State machine abuse, workflow skip, limit bypass, payment logic |
| Crypto / Math | Overflow, precision loss, signature replay, EIP-712, nonce issues |
| Race Conditions | Front-running, sandwich, TOCTOU, rotation window races |
| Economic Security | Flash loans, oracle manipulation, inflation attacks, DeFi tokenomics |
| Recon | Subdomain takeover, secret leaks, cloud misconfig, chain explorer recon |

**Supported chains:** Ethereum / EVM · Aptos / Move · Solana / Anchor · TRON

**Report formats:** HackerOne · Bugcrowd · Intigriti · Immunefi · Generic

## Installation

### Claude Code (terminal)

```bash
# Download the .skill file from releases, then:
unzip bug-bounty-hunter.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or clone directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeffreyxdev/bug-bounty-hunter.git ~/.claude/skills/bug-bounty-hunter
```

Start a fresh Claude Code session — skills load at startup.

### Claude.ai (web/app)

1. Go to **Customize → Skills**
2. Make sure **Code execution** is enabled in **Settings → Capabilities**
3. Upload the `.skill` file

## Usage

### Audit a contract or repo

```
audit contracts/
```
```
run bug bounty hunter on src/usdc.move --platform immunefi --cvss --file-output
```
```
check this contract for vulns --platform h1 --cvss
```

### Web / API target

```
bug bounty hunt on https://api.target.com
```
```
find vulns in this API — [paste endpoints / Swagger / JS bundle]
```

### Generate a report from findings

```
write a HackerOne report for this finding: [paste notes]
```
```
generate immunefi report --cvss: [describe the vuln]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--platform h1` | Format output for HackerOne |
| `--platform immunefi` | Immunefi template |
| `--platform bugcrowd` | Bugcrowd format |
| `--platform intigriti` | Intigriti format |
| `--cvss` | Include full CVSS 3.1 vector string + justification |
| `--file-output` | Save report to `bug-bounty-report-[timestamp].md` |
| `--full` | Run all 8 agents regardless of detected file type |

## How It Works

```
Discover files / scope
        ↓
Build agent bundles (source + agent instructions)
        ↓
Spawn 8 agents in parallel
        ↓
Deduplicate findings by (Target | location | bug-class)
        ↓
Gate evaluation: Refutation → Reachability → Trigger → Impact
        ↓
CVSS 3.1 scoring
        ↓
Submission-ready report
```

Every finding passes four gates before it's confirmed:

1. **Refutation** — can the attack be concretely blocked by an existing guard?
2. **Reachability** — can the vulnerable state exist in a live deployment?
3. **Trigger** — can an unprivileged actor execute it profitably?
4. **Impact** — is there material harm to an identifiable victim?

Fail any gate → rejected or demoted to a lead for manual review.

## Tips

- **Target hot contracts.** Point the tool at the 2–5 files you're actively reviewing rather than an entire repo. Smaller scope = denser context per agent = higher-signal findings.
- **Run more than once.** LLM output is non-deterministic — each run can surface different vulnerabilities. Two or three passes often catch what a single pass misses.
- **Chain findings.** The tool automatically detects composite chains (e.g., auth bypass → privilege escalation) and reports them as a combined severity.
- **Use `--file-output`** when submitting. It saves a clean markdown report you can paste directly into the platform.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/bug-bounty-hunter
git pull
```

The skill checks for updates automatically on each run and will warn you if a newer version is available.
